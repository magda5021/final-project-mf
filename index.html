    <p>Poland</p>
    <p>Poland is a country located in Central Europe. It is divided into 16 administrative  provinces, covering an area of 312,696 km2 (120,733 sq mi), and has a 
        largely temperate seasonal climate. Poland has a population of nearly 38.5 million people, and is the fifth-most populous member state of the European Union.
        Warsaw is the nation's capital and largest metropolis. Other major cities include Krakow, Łódź, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk, and Szczecin. Poland's territory 
        extends from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains in the south. The country is bordered by Lithuania and Russia 
        (Kaliningrad Oblast) to the northeast, Belarus and Ukraine to the east, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south, and Germany to the west.
        In the mid-1500s, Poland was the largest state in Europe. However during Partisions of Poland (1772-1918) by Russia, Prussia nad Austria, Poland 
        disappeared from the map. In 1918 Poland was restored as a nation but suffered tremendously during both World Was especially the second one. 
        During World War II Poland's historucally strong Jewis polulation was alomst wholly annihilated in the Holocaust. Millions of non-Jewis polish people also
        died and Poland lost its independence once again, becoming a communistc state under Soviet Union. In the late 1970s, Poland's workers in the 
        support of Catholic Church created nationwide movement called Solidarity. The movement began to fight with communistc goverment by spreading 
        information about its values and agenda through newspapers. In May 1989 the geverment fell and Poland became a democrtic country.

    <p>Even at the time of national crisis POland culture remained strong. Polish culture flourished in Poland and even far from home. Polish revolutionary 
        ideals, carried by patriots like Kazimierz Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko, informed those of the American Revolution. The Polish constitution of 1791,
        which is the oldest in Europe, incorporated ideals of the American and French revolutions. Poles settled in great number in the United States, Canada,
        Argentina, and Australia where they carried their culture with them. Now in 21st century Poland is flourishing and it is a member of NATO and European
        Union.
